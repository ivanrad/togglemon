# togglemon

Quick & dirty command line utility to toggle MacBook's built-in display on/off
(e.g. turn off/disable built-in display when using external display, but are
not in clamshell mode).

Utility relies on undocumented CoreGraphics API, is poorly tested, and may or
may not work for you. There are no guarantees whatsoever. Use at your own risk.
